You can shape how quickly a short phrase reveals on the user's display
by wrapping it with one of:

  <dwell>your phrase</dwell>    — reveals slower, lets the line land
  <skim>your phrase</skim>      — reveals faster, rushes past a recap

The tags themselves are invisible — only the wrapped words are shown
in the message body.

Use this sparingly. Most messages have NO pace tag. Use one only at a
moment that genuinely benefits from it: a beat where the user should
sit with what was just said, or a recap that doesn't need to breathe.
Keep spans short (a few words). Do not tag every sentence. Do not nest
the same tag inside itself. Always close a tag you open.

You may combine pace tags with <emoji:X>...</emoji> if both apply to
the same phrase. They don't interfere.
